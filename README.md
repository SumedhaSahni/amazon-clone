<p id="description">In this project I've meticulously crafted a landing page that captures the essence of Amazon's user interface visual aesthetics and user experience. While this is a front-end endeavor I've focused on replicating key features and elements that users encounter when visiting Amazon.com.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Interactive Elements: I've incorporated interactive buttons hover effects and modals to enhance user engagement and interactivity.
*   Responsive Design: The landing page is designed with a mobile-first approach ensuring seamless display and functionality across different devices and screen sizes.
*   Dynamic Header: The header includes a responsive navigation bar showcasing categories and search functionality mirroring Amazon's ease of access
